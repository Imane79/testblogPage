🧩 1. <table> — The Container

<table>
  ...
</table>

-This is the main wrapper that holds everything.
-Everything related to the calendar (headers, rows, cells) goes inside here.

📌 2. <caption> — The Title of the Table

<caption>March 2025</caption>

-Gives the table a visible title (like a heading).
-It appears above the table by default.

🧠 3. <thead> — The Days of the Week (Header Row)
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Sun</th>
    <th>Mon</th>
    <th>Tue</th>
    <th>Wed</th>
    <th>Thu</th>
    <th>Fri</th>
    <th>Sat</th>
  </tr>
</thead>

-<thead> is for the header section of the table.
-<tr> means “table row.”
-Inside the row, we use <th> (table header) for each day of the week.

📅 4. <tbody> — The Calendar Days (All the Weeks)
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td>
  </tr>

-<tbody> holds all the calendar rows.
-Each <tr> is a week.
-Each <td> is a day cell.

🕳️ 5. Empty <td></td> — Blank Days Before Month Starts
In March 2025, the 1st is on a Saturday, so the week starts with 6 empty days:
<tr>
  <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td>
</tr>
🔁 6. More Rows for the Rest of the Month
<tr>
  <td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td>
</tr>

-These continue to fill each week row with dates.
-Each row = one calendar week.
